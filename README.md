## Setup

- Create your virtual environment:
```bash
virtualenv <env_name>
```
- Then activate your virtual environment by (in my case that is setting env in Ubuntu):
```bash
cd env/bin/
source activate
```
**Vitrual env is always deactivating when you turn off your computer,
so you need to repeat the process everytime you watch the computer.**

- Starting a project:
```bash
django-admin startproject <project_name>
```
